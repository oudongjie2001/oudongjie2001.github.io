## About Dongjie Ou(Ê¨ß‰∏úÊù∞)
I am Dongjie Ou, a master‚Äôs student at the School of Economics, Southwest University of Political Science and Law.  My advisor is [Associate Professor Lijun Yang(Êù®‰∏ΩÂêõ)](https://es.swupl.edu.cn/szdw/zrjs/ax/x1gjjjymyx/283110.htm). My research interests lie in **Open Digital Economy, Urban (Agglomeration) and Regional Economics, Industrial Economics, and International Trade**. My work involves both reduced-form and structural analyses. My future research will focus on **_the spatial political economy from the perspective of ‚ÄúStructure‚ÄìFactors‚ÄìOpenness‚Äù: exploring the coupling mechanisms among structural adjustment, factor mobility, and institutional opening-up_**.

I am an optimistic idealist. Outside of my academic life, I enjoy music, hiking and trips. I grew up in Dazu District, Chongqing, located in Southwest China. It is a beautiful city.
