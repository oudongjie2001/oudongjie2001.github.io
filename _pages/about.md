## About Dongjie Ou(欧东杰)

I am Dongjie Ou, a master’s student at the School of Economics, Southwest University of Political Science and Law.  My advisor is [Associate Professor Lijun Yang(杨丽君)](https://es.swupl.edu.cn/szdw/zrjs/ax/x1gjjjymyx/283110.htm). My research interests lie in **urban (agglomeration) and regional economics, industrial economics, and international trade**. My work involves both reduced-form and structural analyses.

Outside of my academic life, I am an aviation enthusiast and enjoys music, hiking and trips. I grew up in Chongqing, a beautiful city in southwest China.
